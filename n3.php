<h1><b>Numbness</b></h1>
<p>Numbness and tingling are unusual prickling sensations that can happen in any part of your body. People generally notice these sensations in hands, feet, arms, and legs. Many things can cause numbness and tingling, including sitting with your legs crossed or falling asleep on your arm.</p>
<p>If numbness and tingling persist and there’s no obvious cause for the sensations, it could be a symptom of a disease or injury, such as multiple sclerosis or carpal tunnel syndrome. Treatment will depend on your diagnosis.The medical term for numbness and tingling is paresthesia.</p>

<h1><b>What Causes Numbness and Tingling?</b></h1>
<p>Many things can cause numbness and tingling, including some medications. Things that we do every day can sometimes cause numbness, including sitting or standing in one position for a long time, sitting with your legs crossed, or falling asleep on your arm. These are all examples of blood flow being cut off to an area for a period of time.There are numerous conditions that can cause you to feel numbness and tingling. For example, an insect or animal bite, toxins found in seafood, a migraine headache, or radiation therapy can give you a feeling of pins and needles. An abnormal level of vitamin B-12, potassium, calcium or sodium is another potential cause. Radiation therapy can also produce this odd sensation.</p>
<h1><b>Home Remedies</b></h1>
<ul>
	<li><b>Take breaks from repetitive tasks:</b>Whether you’re typing, playing guitar, or using a hand drill, try setting a timer beforehand for 15 minutes. When it goes off, stop what you’re doing and wiggle your fingers. Stretch your hands and move your wrists to improve blood flow to these areas.</li>
	<li><b>Mind your flexion:</b>Avoid activities that make your wrists flex to the extreme in either direction. Try keeping your wrists neutral as much as possible.</li>
	<li><b>Stay warm:</b>Keeping your hands warm can help with pain and stiffness. Consider wearing fingerless gloves or keeping hand warmers nearby.</li>
	<li><b>Stretch it out:</b>You can do quick wrist exercises while you’re standing in line at the grocery store or sitting at your desk at work. For example, make a fist and then slide your fingers until they are straight again. Repeat this action five to 10 times. This can help relive any pressure on your wrist.</li>
