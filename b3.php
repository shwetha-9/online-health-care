<h1><b>What causes blackheads?</b></h1>
<p>Blackheads form when a clog or plug develops in the opening of hair follicles in your skin. Each follicle contains one hair and a sebaceous gland that produces oil. This oil, called sebum, helps keep your skin soft. Dead skin cells and oils collect in the opening to the skin follicle, producing a bump called a comedo. If the skin over the bump stays closed, the bump is called a whitehead. When the skin over the bump opens, exposure to the air causes it to look black and a blackhead forms.<br>

Some factors can increase your chances of developing acne and blackheads, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>producing too much body oil</li>
	<li>the buildup of the Propionibacterium acnes bacteria on the skin</li>
	<li>irritation of the hair follicles when dead skins cells don’t shed on a regular basis</li>
	<li>undergoing hormonal changes that cause an increase in oil production during the teen years, during menstruation, or while taking birth control pills</li>
	<li>taking certain drugs, such as corticosteroids, lithium, or androgens</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people believe that what you eat or drink can affect acne. Dairy products and foods that increase blood sugar levels, such as carbohydrates, may play a part in triggering acne, but researchers aren’t convinced that there’s a strong connection.</p>
<h1><b>How can blackheads be prevented?</b></h1>
<p>You can prevent blackheads without spending a lot of money by trying a few of the following ideas:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Wash regularly</b>Wash your face when you wake up and before you go to bed to remove oil buildup. Washing more than twice each day can irritate your skin and make your acne worse. Use a gentle cleanser that doesn’t make your skin red or irritated. Some acne cleansing products have antibacterial ingredients that kill P. acnes bacteria.<br>Consider washing your hair every day, too, particularly if it’s oily. Hair oils can contribute to clogged pores. It’s also important to wash your face after you eat oily foods such as pizza, because oil from these foods can clog pores.</li>
	<li><b>Use oil-free products</b>Any product that contains oil can contribute to new blackheads. Choose oil-free or noncomedogenic makeup, lotions, and sunscreens to avoid making your problem worse.</li>
	<li><b>Try an exfoliating product</b>Exfoliating scrubs and masks remove dead skin cells from your face and can help reduce blackheads. Look for products that don’t irritate your skin.</li>
