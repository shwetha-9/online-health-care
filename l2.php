<h1><b>Loss Of hairs/b></h1>
<p>The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) notes that 80 million men and women in America have hereditary hair loss (alopecia). It can affect just the hair on your scalp or your entire body. Although it’s more prevalent in older adults, excessive hair loss can occur in children as well.</p>
<p>It’s impossible to count the amount of hair lost on a given day. You may be losing more hair than is normal if you notice a large amount of hair in the drain after washing your hair or clumps of hair in your brush. You might also notice thinning patches of hair or baldness.If you notice that you’re losing more hair than usual, you should discuss the problem with your doctor. They can determine the underlying cause of your hair loss and suggest appropriate treatment plans.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Hormonal changes associated with pregnancy, childbirth, discontinuing the use of birth control pills, and menopause can cause temporary hair loss.</li>
	<li>Medical conditions that can cause hair loss include thyroid disease, alopecia areata (an autoimmune disease that attacks hair follicles), and scalp infections like ringworm.</li>
	<li>Hair loss can also be due to medications used to treat cancer, high blood pressure, arthritis, depression, and heart problems.</li>
	<li>A physical or emotional shock may trigger noticeable hair loss.</li>
	<li>A diet lacking in protein, iron, and other nutrients can lead to thinning hair.Traction hair loss can be due to hairstyles that put pressure on the follicles by pulling the hair back very tightly.</li>
</ul>
<h1><b>How Is Hair Loss Diagnosed?</b></h1>
<p>Persistent hair loss often indicates an underlying health issue. Your doctor or dermatologist can determine the cause of your hair loss based on a physical examination and your health history. In some cases, simple dietary changes can help, along with switching prescription medications.If your dermatologist suspects an autoimmune or skin disease, they might take a biopsy of the skin on your scalp. This will involve carefully removing a small section of skin for laboratory testing. It’s important to keep in mind that hair growth is a complex process, so it may take time to determine the exact cause of your hair loss.</p>
<h1><b>Home Remedies</b></h1>
<ul>
	<li><b>Massage:</b>Massaging the scalp can help to restore hair growth and can be used in conjunction with hair oils and masks. This stimulates the scalp and can improve hair thickness. Taking the time to massage your scalp each day can also help you relieve stress and tension. It’s thought that stretching forces during the massage encourage hair growth and thickness in the dermal papilla cells.</li>
	<li><b>Aloe vera:</b>Aloe vera has long been used for treating hair loss. It also soothes the scalp and conditions hair. It can reduce dandruff and unblock hair follicles that may be blocked by excess oil. You can apply pure aloe vera gel to your scalp and hair a few times per week. You can also use shampoo and conditioner that contain aloe vera.</li>
	<li><b>Coconut oil:</b>It contains fatty acids that penetrate inside the hair shaft and reduce protein loss from hair. Coconut oil can be used either before or after you wash your hair depending on your hair type. If your hair tends to be oily, you can do a leave-in treatment overnight or for a few hours before you wash it. Massage coconut oil into your scalp and all of your hair. If your hair is dry, you can also use it as a leave-in treatment. There needs to be more research on coconut oil as a promoter of hair growth, but it’s been shown to improve the health and luster of hair and has been used for centuries.</li>
	<li><b>Onion juice:</b>If you can handle the smell of onion juice, you may find that the benefits are worth it. Onion juice has been shown to successfully treat patchy alopecia areata by promoting hair growth. Onion juice is also thought to improve circulation. Animal studies show improved keratin growth factor and blood flow to the cuticles. You can blend a few onions and squeeze out the juice. Apply the juice to your scalp and hair and leave in for at least 15 minutes. Then shampoo normally.</li>
	<li><b>Lemon:</b>You can use fresh lemon juice or lemon oil since they are said to enhance hair quality and growth. Lemon oil can help you to maintain a healthy scalp and encourage hair growth. Apply fresh lemon juice to your scalp and hair 15 minutes before you shampoo. You can use lemon essential oil diluted in a carrier oil as a hair mask.</li>
