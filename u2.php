<h1><b>What Causes Urinary Hesitancy?</b></h1>
<p>If you have trouble starting to urinate or maintaining urine flow, you may have urinary hesitancy. It can occur in men and women at any age, but it’s most common in older men. In some cases, it may lead to urinary retention. This happens when you’re unable to urinate. It can be very serious.</p>
<p>Urinary hesitancy can result from a variety of medical conditions. If you experience it, make an appointment with your doctor. They can help pinpoint the cause of your condition and offer treatment options. </p>
<p>There are many possible causes of urinary hesitancy. In men, the condition is usually caused by a benign enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia). In both men and women, it may also result from:</p>
<ul>
<li>bladder muscle disorders</li>
<li>nerve damage</li>
<li>surgeries</li>
<li>a cancer tumor obstructing the urethra or urinary bladder</li>
</ul>
<h1><b>Diagnosing urinary hesitancy</b></h1>
<p>To diagnose the underlying cause of urinary hesitancy or other problems with urination, your doctor will likely start by taking your medical history. For example, they’ll want to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>how long you’ve been experiencing urinary hesitancy</li>	
<li>if it developed gradually or suddenly</li>
<li>if your urine flow is weak</li>
<li>if anything seems to relieve or worsen your symptoms</li>
</ul>
<p>They may also ask you about other symptoms that you’ve experienced. Be sure you mention any other medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with and any medications or supplements that you’re taking.</p>
<p>Your doctor may also order one or more tests to help determine the cause of your symptoms. For example, they may collect a sample of your urine for analysis. They may swab the inside of your urethra. In some cases, they may need to insert a small flexible tube, known as a catheter, into your urethra. This allows them to collect a sample of urine directly from your bladder. </p>
<p>Your doctor may also conduct one or more of the following urodynamic studies: </p>
<ul>
<li>Uroflowmetry measures the volume and flow rate of urine expelled when you empty your bladder. </li>
<li>Pressure flow testing requires a catheter to measure the pressure in your bladder, which is then compared to the flow rate during urination. </li>
<li>Video urodynamic testing uses a special fluid placed via catheter into your bladder in order to create contrast imaging during filling and emptying of the bladder.</li>	
</ul>
<p>If you’re male, your doctor may conduct a rectal prostate exam. They may also create an image of your prostate using an ultrasound or other imaging technology. </p>
<h1><b>Treating urinary hesitancy</b></h1>
<p>Your doctor’s recommended treatment plan will depend on the underlying cause of your symptoms. Depending on your diagnosis, they may recommend medications, surgery, or other treatments. </p>
<p>In some cases, home remedies may help relieve your symptoms. For example, it may help to place a hot water bottle or heating pad on your lower abdomen. This can help relax your muscles and may improve your urine flow. Gently massaging the area may also help increase urine flow. It’s also important to drink plenty of fluids. </p>
