<h1><b>What Causes Hoarseness?</b></h1>
<h3>Hoarseness</h3>
<p>Hoarseness, an abnormal change in your voice, is a common condition thatâ€™s often experienced in conjunction with a dry or scratchy throat. If your voice is hoarse, you may have a raspy, weak, or airy quality to your voice that prevents you from making smooth vocal sounds.</p>
<p>This symptom commonly stems from an issue with the vocal cords and may involve an inflamed larynx (voice box). This is known as laryngitis. If you have persistent hoarseness lasting for more than 10 days, seek prompt medical attention, as you may have a serious underlying medical condition.</p>
<p>Hoarseness is typically caused by a viral infection in the upper respiratory tract. Other common factors that can cause, contribute to, or worsen your condition include:</p>
<ul>
<li>acid reflux</li>
<li>smoking</li>
<li>drinking caffeinated and alcoholic beverages</li>
<li>screaming, prolonged singing, or otherwise overusing your vocal cords</li>
<li>allergies</li>
<li>inhaling toxic substances</li>
<li>coughing excessively</li>
</ul>
<h1>Prevention</h1>
<p>You can take several actions to prevent hoarseness. Some prevention methods that may help protect your vocal cords are listed below.</p>
<p>Stop smoking and avoid secondhand smoke: Breathing smoke can cause irritation of your vocal cords and larynx and can dry out your throat.</p>
<p>Wash your hands frequently: Hoarseness is often caused by a viral respiratory infection. Washing your hands will help prevent the spread of germs and keep you healthy.</p>
<p>Stay hydrated: Drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day. Fluids thin the mucus in the throat and keep it moist.</p>
<p>Avoid fluids that dehydrate your body, such as caffeinated beverages and alcoholic drinks. These operate as diuretics and cause you to lose water.</p>
<p>Try to resist the urge to clear your throat. This may increase the inflammation of your vocal cords and overall irritation in your throat.</p>
<h1><b>Home remedies</b></h1>
<h2>Salt</h2>
<p>Using salt is the first remedy in this list of home remedies for hoarseness of voice. Weather change is a favorable environment for bacteria to attack the respiratory tract. Rinse mouth and throat with saline to help prevent bacterial attacks have been recommended by many experts.</p>
<p>Saline has a high level of bactericide, which is quite beneficial for human health, but not a cure. Saline can be safely used for all ages, including infants, young children and pregnant women. Before you decide to use the medicine, you can clean your nose and throat with saline.</p>
<p>Saline helps to cleanse the nasal mucosa, wash the mucus as well as other dirt and pollen in the nose and throat. This will help your hoarseness improve significantly, and you will feel a lot more comfortable.</p>
<h3>Method 1. Use Saline To Rinse Mouth And Throat</h3>
<p>In some cases, saline, especially physiological saline, is more effective than antibiotics. Up to 70-80% of sore throats (one of the causes of hoarseness) in adults are caused by viruses. In this case, the antibiotic does not kill the virus causing the disease, so with most cases of sore throat without infection, the use of antibiotics is not necessary. We all know that antibiotics have strong bactericidal effects, it can immediately stop the symptoms of pain, swelling, itching, and cough. But it only works if the cause of sore throat is bacterial. However, antibiotics also kill the beneficial bacteria that exist in the body, especially in the intestinal tract. This reduces the ability of the body to digest, absorbs nutrients.</p>
<p>Saline, especially physiological saline, is an isotonic environment. When the saline reaches the throat, the water in the swollen, inflamed tissue is released. Dehydration in swollen tissues will help reduce inflammation and provide a pleasant sensation. Salt has an antiseptic effect. Light saline enhances the PH environment and prevents bacterial growth (because bacteria need a low pH environment to grow).Therefore, using saline is a simple and effective way to treat sore throat as well as hoarse voice.</p>
<h3>Method 2. Salt And Lemon</h3>
<p>Lemon juice provides vitamin C for anti-bacterial cells. This vitamin in lemon can also kill the virus in the mucous membranes of the nose and throat. The combination of lemon and salt creates a wonderful mixture to treat hoarse voice.</p>
