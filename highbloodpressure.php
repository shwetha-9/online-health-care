<h1><b>What causes high blood pressure?</b></h1>
<p>here are two types of hypertension. Each type has a different cause.</p>
<h3>Primary hypertension</h3>
<p>Primary hypertension is also called essential hypertension. This kind of hypertension develops over time with no identifiable cause. Most people have this type of high blood pressure.<br>

Researchers are still unclear what mechanisms cause blood pressure to slowly increase. A combination of factors may play a role. These factors include:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Genes:</b>Some people are genetically predisposed to hypertension. This may be from gene mutations or genetic abnormalities inherited from your parents.</li>
	<li><b>Physical changes:</b>If something in your body changes, you may begin experiencing issues throughout your body. High blood pressure may be one of those issues. For example, it’s thought that changes in your kidney function due to aging may upset the body’s natural balance of salts and fluid. This change may cause your body’s blood pressure to increase.</li>
	<li><b>Environment:</b>Over time, unhealthy lifestyle choices like lack of physical activity and poor diet can take their toll on your body. Lifestyle choices can lead to weight problems. Being overweight or obese can increase your risk for hypertension.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Secondary hypertension</h3>
<p>Secondary hypertension often occurs quickly and can become more severe than primary hypertension. Several conditions that may cause secondary hypertension include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>kidney disease</li>
	<li>obstructive sleep apnea</li>
	<li>congenital heart defects</li>
	<li>problems with your thyroid</li>
	<li>side effects of medications</li>
	<li>use of illegal drugs</li>
	<li>alcohol abuse or chronic use</li>
	<li>adrenal gland problems</li>
	<li>certain endocrine tumors</li>
</ul>
<h1><b>Treatment options for high blood pressure</b></h1>
<p>A number of factors help your doctor determine the best treatment option for you. These factors include which type of hypertension you have and what causes have been identified.</p>
<h3>Primary hypertension treatment options</h3>
<p>If your doctor diagnoses you with primary hypertension, lifestyle changes may help reduce your high blood pressure. If lifestyle changes alone aren’t enough, or if they stop being effective, your doctor may prescribe medication.</p>
<h3>Secondary hypertension treatment options</h3>
<p>If your doctor discovers an underlying issue causing your hypertension, treatment will focus on that other condition. For example, if a medicine you’ve started taking is causing increased blood pressure, your doctor will try other medicines that don’t have this side effect.<br>

Sometimes, hypertension is persistent despite treatment for the underlying cause. In this case, your doctor may work with you to develop lifestyle changes and prescribe medications to help reduce your blood pressure.<br>

Treatment plans for hypertension often evolve. What worked at first may become less useful over time. Your doctor will continue to work with you to refine your treatment.</p>
<h1><b>Home remedies for high blood pressure</b></h1>
<p>Healthy lifestyle changes can help you control the factors that cause hypertension. Here are some of the most common home remedies.</p>
<h3>Developing a healthy diet</h3>
<p>A heart-healthy diet is vital for helping to reduce high blood pressure. It’s also important for managing hypertension that is under control and reducing the risk of complications. These complications include heart disease, stroke, and heart attack.<br>

A heart-healthy diet emphasizes foods that include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>fruits</li>
	<li>vegetables</li>
	<li>whole grains</li>
	<li>lean proteins like fish</li>
</ul>
<h3>Increasing physical activity</h3>
<p>Reaching a healthy weight should include being more physically active. In addition to helping you shed pounds, exercise can help reduce stress, lower blood pressure naturally, and strengthen your cardiovascular system.<br>

Aim to get 150 minutes of moderate physical activity each week. That’s about 30 minutes five times per week.</p>
<h3>Reaching a healthy weight</h3>
<p>If you are overweight or obese, losing weight through a heart-healthy diet and increased physical activity can help lower your blood pressure.</p>
<h3>Managing stress</h3>
<p>Exercise is a great way to manage stress. Other activities can also be helpful. These include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>meditation</li>
	<li>deep breathing</li>
	<li>massage</li>
	<li>muscle relaxation</li>
	<li>yoga or tai chi</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all proven stress-reducing techniques. Getting adequate sleep can also help reduce stress levels.</p>
<h3>Adopting a cleaner lifestyle</h3>
<p>If you’re a smoker, try to quit. The chemicals in tobacco smoke damage the body’s tissues and harden blood vessel walls.<br>

If you regularly consume too much alcohol or have an alcohol dependency, seek help to reduce the amount you drink or stop altogether. Alcohol can raise blood pressure.</p>
