<h1><b>Painfull Menstruation</b></h1>
<p>Menstruation occurs when the uterus sheds its lining once a month. The lining passes through a small opening in the cervix and out through the vaginal canal.Some pain, cramping, and discomfort during menstrual periods is normal. Excessive pain that causes you to miss work or school is not.</p>
<p>Painful menstruation is also called dysmenorrhea. There are two types of dysmenorrhea: primary and secondary. Primary dysmenorrhea occurs in women who experience pain before and during menstruation. Women who have had normal periods that become painful later in life may have secondary dysmenorrhea. A condition affecting the uterus or other pelvic organs, such as endometriosis or uterine fibroids, can cause this.</p>
<ul>
	<li>a painful medical condition in which cells from the lining of the uterus grow in other parts of the body, usually on the fallopian tubes, ovaries, or tissue lining the pelvis</li>
	<li>noncancerous tumors that can put pressure on the uterus or cause abnormal menstruation and pain</li>
	<li>an infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries often caused by sexually transmitted bacteria that causes inflammation of the reproductive organs and pain.</li>
	<li>a group of symptoms caused by hormonal changes in the body that occur 1 to 2 weeks before menstruation begins and go away after a woman begins to bleed.</li>
	<li>a rare condition in which the uterine lining grows into the muscular wall of the uterus and can be painful because it causes inflammation and pressure.</li>
	<li>a rare condition in which the cervix is so small it slows menstrual flow, causing an increase of pressure inside the uterus that causes pain.</li>
</ul>
<h1><b>Diagnosis</b></h1>
<p>Your doctor will first take your medical history to check for the underlying causes of your painful menstrual periods. They will also perform a physical examination. This will include a pelvic exam to check for any abnormalities in your reproductive system and to look for signs of infection.</p>
<h1><b>Home Remedies</b></h1>
<ul>
	<li><b>Taking over-the-counter (OTC) medications:</b>There are the primary over-the-counter (OTC) form of pain relief recommended for menstrual pain and heavy menstrual bleeding. NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Advil) and naproxen (Aleve).=These drugs help lower your body’s production of prostaglandin. NSAIDs aren’t as effective as oral contraception, but they can help reduce pain.</li>
	<li><b>Applying heat:</b>Applying heat to your abdomen and lower back may relieve pain. A 2012 study focused on 147 women 18 to 30 years old who had regular menstrual cycles found that a heat patch at 104°F (40°C) was as effective as ibuprofen.</li>
	<li><b>Avoiding certain foods:</b>Reducing or cutting out these foods can help alleviate cramps and decrease tension. Instead, try soothing (caffeine-free) ginger or mint teas or hot water flavored with lemon. If you need a sugar fix, snack on fruits such as strawberries or raspberries.</li>
	<li><b>Adding herbs to your diet:</b>These herbal remedies contain anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic compounds that experts believe can reduce the muscle contractions and swelling associated with menstrual pain.</li>
