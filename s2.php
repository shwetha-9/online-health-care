<h1><b>What Causes Shoulder Pain?</b></h1>
<P>The shoulder has a wide and versatile range of motion. When something goes wrong with your shoulder, it hampers your ability to move freely and can cause a great deal of pain and discomfort.</P>
<p>The shoulder is a ball-and-socket joint that has three main bones: the humerus (long arm bone), the clavicle (collarbone), and the scapula (also known as the shoulder blade). These bones are cushioned by a layer of cartilage. There are two main joints. The acromioclavicular joint is between the highest part of the scapula and the clavicle. The glenohumeral joint is made up of the top, ball-shaped part of the humerus bone and the outer edge of the scapula. This joint is also known as the shoulder joint.</p>
<p>The shoulder joint is the most mobile joint in the body. It moves the shoulder forward and backward. It also allows the arm to move in a circular motion, and to move up and away from the body.</p>
<p>Shoulders get their range of motion from the rotator cuff. The rotator cuff is made up of four tendons. Tendons are the tissues that connect muscles to bone. It may be painful or difficult to lift your arm over your head if the tendons or bones around the rotator cuff are damaged or swollen.</p>
<p>You can injure your shoulder by performing manual labor, playing sports, or even by repetitive movement. Certain diseases can bring about pain that travels to the shoulder. These include diseases of the cervical spine of the neck, as well as liver, heart, or gallbladder disease.</p>
<p>You’re more likely to have problems with your shoulder as you grow older. It is especially common after age 60. This is because the soft tissues surrounding the shoulder tend to degenerate with age.</p>
<p>In many cases, you can treat shoulder pain at home. However, physical therapy, medications, or surgery may also be necessary.</p>
<h1><b>Prevention</b></h1>
<p>Simple shoulder exercises can help stretch and strengthen muscles and rotator cuff tendons. A physical therapist or occupational therapist can show you how to do them properly.</p>
<p>If you’ve had previous issues with your shoulders, use ice for 15 minutes after exercising to prevent future injuries.</p>
<p>After a bout of bursitis or tendinitis, performing simple range-of-motion exercises every day can keep you from getting frozen shoulder.</p>
<h1><b>Home remedies</b></h1>
<h3>1. Take over the counter Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory medications or NSAIDS. There are two major generic types of NSAIDS: Ibuprofen and Naproxen. </h3>
<p>Both used to be by prescription and are relatively safe to use per their labels. Brand names include Advil (for Ibuprofen) and Aleve (for naproxen). Use only if approved by your physician.</p>
<h3>2.Apply heat to your shoulder.</h3>
<p>This can be accomplished by a mild hot shower on your shoulder for about 5 to 10 minutes. Or you can use an electric hot pack. If using the electric hot pack, set on medium heat not high heat level.</p>
<p>Research shows us that our bodies respond to medium heat levels better than intense heat levels. Also, microwave pellets or “rice” hot packs work well at home.</p>
<p>But be careful not to apply heat to an acute or new injury. Check out this article to understand the difference between heat and ice. </p>
<h3>3. Apply ice to your shoulder.</h3>
<p>A cold pack inside a pillow case for ten minutes can be great. Ice massage is also an option but ice should not be left in direct contact with the skin for over 5 minutes due to the very real possibility of frostbite.</p>
<h3>4. Stretches</h3>
<p>Stretching the musculature that encompasses the shoulder joint can not only help with your pain but can also possibly prevent future injury. Muscles that are capable of moving freely through your shoulder's natural motion will not have the constant stress that a tight muscle experiences. If you are looking for new ways to stretch, read up on these 9 yoga poses you can do from home. </p>
