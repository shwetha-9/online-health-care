<h1><b>Lazy Eye</b></h1>
<p>The medical term for lazy eye is “amblyopia.” Lazy eye occurs when your brain favors one eye, often due to poor vision in your other eye. Eventually, your brain might ignore signals from your weak or “lazy” eye. The condition can result in vision impairment and loss of depth perception.Your affected eye doesn’t necessarily look different, although it may “wander” in different directions. That’s where the term “lazy” comes from. The condition will usually only affect one of your eyes, but in certain circumstances, the vision in both of your eyes can be affected.</p>
<p>The condition usually occurs in children. According to the Mayo Clinic, it’s the leading cause of vision problems among children.It’s important to note that lazy eye isn’t the same as a crossed or turned eye. That condition is called strabismus. However, strabismus can lead to lazy eye if your crossed eye gets much less use than your uncrossed one.If your lazy eye goes untreated, temporary or permanent loss of vision can occur. This can include loss of both depth perception and 3D vision.</p>
<ul>
	<li>constant strabismus, or turning of one eye</li>
	<li>constant strabismus, or turning of one eye</li>
	<li>different levels of vision in each of your eye</li>
	<li>damage to one of your eyes from trauma</li>
	<li>vision impairment, such as nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism</li>
	<li>glaucoma, which is high pressure in your eye that can lead to vision problems and blindness</li>
</ul>
<h1><b>How Is Lazy Eye Diagnosed?</b></h1>
<p>Lazy eye usually occurs in only one eye. When it first occurs, parents and children often don’t notice the condition. It’s important to get routine eye exams as an infant and child, even if you show no outward symptoms of eye problems. The American Optometric Association recommends that children have eye exams when they are 6 months old and 3 years old. After that, children should receive routine exams every two years, or more frequently, from age 6 to 18.</p>
<h1><b>Home Remedies</b></h1>
<ul>
	<li><b>Eye drops:</b>Over-the-counter eye drops for itch relief are always helpful.Some are designed for allergies and redness, while others work like artificial tears for dryness. The best types are preservative free. Some help all these conditions in addition to itching.</li>
	<li><b>Cold compress:</b>A cold-water compress can relive the itch and have a soothing effect on your eyes. Simply take a clean cloth, soak it in cold water, and apply to closed itchy eyes, repeating as often as needed.</li>
