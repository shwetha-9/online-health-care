<h1><b>Jaundice</b></h1>
<p>“Jaundice” is the medical term that describes yellowing of the skin and eyes. Jaundice itself is not a disease, but it is a symptom of several possible underlying illnesses. Jaundice forms when there is too much bilirubin in your system. Bilirubin is a yellow pigment that is created by the breakdown of dead red blood cells in the liver. </p>
<p>Normally, the liver gets rid of bilirubin along with old red blood cells.Jaundice may indicate a serious problem with the function of your red blood cells, liver, gallbladder, or pancreas.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Drink at least eight glasses of fluids per day. Water and herbal tea are excellent options.</li>
	<li>Refined sugar can cause fat buildup in your liver, so opt for foods containing natural sugars. Use agave as a sweetener and look to fruits to satisfy your sweet tooth.</li>
	<li>Fatigue, lethargy, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, itching skin, right upper abdominal pain, yellow skin or eyes, and fluid buildup in the abdomen are possible symptoms.</li>
	<li>Severe cases of jaundice are treated with blood transfusions to remove bilirubin.</li>
	<li>liver function tests, a series of blood tests that measure levels of certain proteins and enzymes the liver produces when it’s healthy and when it’s damaged.</li>
</ul>
<h1><b>What’s newborn jaundice?</b></h1>
<p>Newborn jaundice is a yellowing of a baby’s skin and eyes. Newborn jaundice is very common and can occur when babies have a high level of bilirubin, a yellow pigment produced during normal breakdown of red blood cells.</p>
<h1><b>Home Remedies</b></h1>
<ul>
	<li><b>Sunlight:</b>One of the most widely used treatments to cure jaundice in infants is phototherapy. However, a study states that exposure to sunlight can be even more effective than phototherapy in treating neonatal jaundice as it helps in the isomerization of bilirubin molecules.</li>
	<li><b>Sugarcane Juice:</b>Drink one to two glasses of sugarcane juice.You must drink this juice daily until your condition gets better.Since sugarcane juice helps in strengthening your liver, it is a great remedy to cure jaundice.</li>
	<li><b>Green Grape Juice:</b>Green grape juice is believed to absorb the yellowness by enhancing the functioning of your liver. This can improve the serum bilirubin levels and cure jaundice.</li>
	<li><b>Vitamin D:</b>Since newborn infants are hardly exposed to the sun, they are often deficient in vitamin D. According to a study published in the Journal of the Chinese Medical Association, jaundiced infants were observed to be deficient in vitamin D as compared to non-jaundiced infants.</li>
    <li><b>Yogurt:</b>Probiotic yogurt can help in bringing down your serum bilirubin levels by enhancing your immunity and regulating the bacterial colonies in your body. Infants also benefit from probiotic supplementation. Hence, breastfeeding mothers can increase their intake of probiotic yogurt to aid the recovery of their babies.</li>
