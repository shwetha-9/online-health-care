<h1><b>Causes of Cleft Palate and Lip</b></h1>
<p>The cause of cleft palate and lip isn’t known, but doctors believe that the defects occur because of both genetic and environmental factors. Genetics can play a role in the development of clefts if one or both parents pass down a gene that makes a cleft palate or lip more likely.<br>What you do during your pregnancy can also increase the likelihood that your child will have a cleft palate or lip. Factors that scientists believe may cause a cleft to develop include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>cigarette smoking</li>
	<li>drinking alcohol</li>
	<li>taking illegal drugs</li>
	<li>being diabetic</li>
	<li>not getting enough prenatal vitamins, like folic acid</li>
</ul>
<h1><b>Prevention</b></h1>
<ul>
	<li><b>Folic acid supplements:</b>A shortage of folic acid in the body has been linked to children who develop cleft lip and palate. Though the evidence to support this thesis is not all that strong, it is none the less advised that you take a folic acid supplement during the first two months of pregnancy. This is the period during which the roof of the baby’s mouth and the lips develop in the womb. You should ask your physician for advice on the level of folic acid supplements you should be taking.</li>
	<li><b>Medication:</b>There are several drugs and medications that have been linked to the development of cleft lip and palate. If you are currently taking medication and are thinking about having a baby then you should discuss this with your doctor. If medication is not of utmost importance then you can choose to stop taking it during the period of pregnancy. Medication that has been linked to the development of cleft lip and palate </li>
	<li><b>Benzodiazepine:</b>Benzodiazepine is a medication that is prescribed to patients suffering from anxiety and insomnia. You should discuss any other methods you can choose to undertake during pregnancy in order to stop using this medication.</li>
	<li><b>Anticonvulsant:</b>Anticonvulsant is a medication that is prescribed to those suffering from epilepsy. It is also prescribed to other conditions that cause seizures. You should discuss the use of this medication with your doctor if you are planning on having children.</li>
	<li><b>Corticosteroid:</b>Corticosteroid is a medication that can have a negative affect during the early stages of pregnancy, during which the roof of the baby’s mouth and the lips develop. This form of medication is prescribed to patients who it is believed may have a premature baby. You will therefore need to consider the positives and negatives of using such medication.</li>
</ul>
<h1><b>Treatment of Cleft Palate and Lip</b></h1>
<p>The treatment for your child’s cleft palate or lip will depend on the severity of the condition. Treatment often involves several surgeries to close the opening and reconstruct the face.<br>A team of specialists may work with you and your child. For example, if your child has problems with speech because of their cleft, they might work with a speech pathologist. Your child’s team may also include a plastic surgeon, an oral surgeon, and/or an orthodontist.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Surgery:</b>Surgery to repair a cleft palate or lip is ideally performed in your child’s first year. However, additional reconstructive surgeries may be required well into your child’s teenage years.</li>
	<li><b>Cleft Lip:</b>It’s recommended that you get your baby’s cleft lip repaired when they’re between 10 weeks and 1 year old. If your child has a particularly wide cleft, your child’s doctor may want to do a lip adhesion that involves sewing the cleft together temporarily until a surgeon performs the repair. During surgery, your child will be put under anesthesia and a surgeon will use tissue and skin from both sides of the cleft lip to make the lip wider and close the gap.</li>
	<li><b>Cleft Palate:</b>Doctors usually perform surgery to repair a cleft palate when a child is between 6 and 18 months old. During surgery, the muscles and tissue on the two sides of the palate are connected together to close the cleft.</li>
</ul>
