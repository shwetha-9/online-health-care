<h1><b>Pale Stools</b></h1>
<p>Normal stools can vary in shades of brown, mostly due to your diet. Pale or clay-colored stools are not normal. If your stools are pale or clay-colored, you may have a problem with the drainage of your biliary system, which is comprised of your gallbladder, liver, and pancreas.Bile salts are released into your stools by your liver, giving the stools a brown color. If your liver is not producing enough bile, or if the flow of the bile is blocked and not draining from your liver, your stools may become pale or clay-colored.</p>
<p>Having pale or clay-colored stools once in a while may not be a cause for concern. If it occurs frequently, you may have a serious illness. You should see your doctor whenever you have pale or clay-colored stools in order to rule out illness and disease.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Gallstones are hardened deposits in the gallbladder that can block the flow of bile.</li>
	<li>Your doctor may also suggest taking vitamins A, K, E, and D, to replace the nutrients that are lost in the fatty stools.</li>
	<li>Calcium supplements can also help prevent loss of bone density.</li>
	<li>biliary drainage catheter: placing a drain in the narrowing of the bile ducts</li>
	<li>a milk-only diet</li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
<h1><b>Complications of pale or clay-colored stools?</b></h1>
<p>One of the most common complications of pale or clay-colored stools is jaundice. This is due to a buildup of bile in your body. Jaundice is a yellowing of your skin or around the whites of your eyes. See your doctor immediately if you have signs of jaundice because it may also be a symptom of liver disease.</p>
<h1><b>Home Remedies</b></h1>
<ul>
	<li><b>Eat a healthy diet:</b>A healthy diet that includes whole grains and foods with lots of fiber, such as beans and apples, will help keep your gut healthy. Increasing the diversity of bacteria in your gut is another way to make sure your intestinal environment stays healthy. You can do this by eating a wide variety of healthy foods.</li>
	<li><b>Take probiotics:</b>These are supplements made up of live microorganisms, usually bacteria. Thereâ€™s mixed evidence for them, but some research suggests that taking probiotics can help the bacteria in your gut stay balanced. Talk to your doctor about adding a probiotic to your daily routine.</li>
	<li><b>Eat fermented foods:</b> Fermented foods, such as sauerkraut, kimchi, and yogurt, are foods that have been altered by bacteria or yeasts. Therefore, they contain a lot of bacteria that can help keep your gut healthy.</li>
