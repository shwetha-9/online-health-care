<h1><b>What Causes Abdominal Rigidity?</b></h1>
<p>Abdominal rigidity is a state of stiffness of your stomach muscles that worsens when you touch (or someone else touches) your abdomen. This is an involuntary response to prevent pain caused by pressure on your abdomen. Another term for this protective mechanism is guarding.</p>
<p>This symptom isn’t the same as intentionally flexing your abdominal muscles or the rigidity associated with severe gas. Guarding is a completely involuntary response of the muscles. In other words, you have no control over it. It’s a sign that your body is trying to protect itself from pain. It can be a symptom of a very serious and even life-threatening medical condition.</p>
<p>The location of pain varies with the location of the organ that’s causing the problem. For medical purposes, your stomach is divided into four sections called quadrants. For instance, stomach ulcers can cause pain in the left, upper quadrant of your abdomen. Gallstones can cause right, upper quadrant pain because they are in the upper right part of your abdomen.</p>
<p>Abdominal pain can also travel to other areas of the abdomen. Appendicitis can start off as right, lower quadrant pain, but the pain can start to move toward your belly button.</p>
<p>The causes of abdominal pain (and rigidity) can be different based on age. Adults (most common in elderly adults) may experience an abscess inside the abdomen, cholecystitis (gallbladder inflammation), cancer, bowel obstruction or blockage, or a perforation or hole in the intestines, stomach, or gall bladder. Pancreatitis, trauma to the abdomen, and peritonitis can also lead to abdominal pain and rigidity.</p>
<p>Adolescents sometimes have painful menstruation (dysmenorrhea), pelvic inflammatory disease (from sexually transmitted infections), ovarian cysts, or peritonitis. Adolescent women may also have abdominal pain and rigidity if they’re pregnant (including an ectopic pregnancy).</p>
<p>Older children may experience urinary tract infections (UTIs), appendicitis, or may have ingested toxins (poisons). Infants can have colic, gastroenteritis (digestive irritation caused by a virus), a viral infection, or pyloric stenosis (narrowing of the stomach outlet).</p>
<h1><b>Prevention</b></h1>
<p>The best methods for preventing a tight stomach will vary depending on the cause.</p>
<p>In some cases, it may not be possible to prevent a tight stomach, such as during pregnancy or food poisoning.</p>
<p>In other cases, the chances of developing the symptoms of a tight stomach can be reduced through:</p>
<ul>
<li>eating a healthful, balanced diet</li>	
<li>staying hydrated</li>
<li>exercising regularly</li>
<li>minimizing stress</li>

<h1><b> What Are the Treatment Options for Abdominal Rigidity?
</b></h1>
<p>The treatment your doctor chooses will depend on the cause of the abdominal rigidity. Obviously, treatment for colic in an infant will be different than treatment for cancer, for instance. While minor conditions may only require monitoring, self-care, and prescription antibiotics, more serious causes of abdominal rigidity could warrant more aggressive treatments.</p>
<p>Depending on your diagnosis, aggressive treatment can include intravenous fluids to prevent dehydration, nasogastric (feeding) tube to provide nourishment, intravenous antibiotic, or surgery.</p>
