<h1><b>What Causes Blood-Tinged Sputum?</b></h1>
<p>Common causes of blood-tinged sputum include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>prolonged, severe coughing</li>
	<li>bronchitis</li>
	<li>nosebleeds</li>
	<li>other chest infections</li>
</ul>
<p>More serious causes of blood-tinged sputum can include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>lung cancer or throat cancer</li>
	<li>pneumonia</li>
	<li>pulmonary embolism, or a blood clot in the lung</li>
	<li>pulmonary edema, or having fluid in the lungs</li>
	<li>pulmonary aspiration, or breathing foreign material into the lung</li>
	<li>cystic fibrosis</li>
	<li>certain infections, such as tuberculosis</li>
	<li>taking anticoagulants, which thin blood to prevent it from clotting</li>
	<li>trauma to the respiratory system</li>
</ul>
<p>Lower respiratory infections or inhaling a foreign object are the likely causes of blood-tinged sputum in children.</p>
<h1><b>Prevention</b></h1>
<p>Blood-tinged sputum can sometimes be a symptom of an underlying condition that’s unavoidable, but methods are available to help prevent some cases of it. The first line of prevention is to take steps to avoid the respiratory infections most likely to cause it.<br>

You can do the following to prevent blood-tinged sputum:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Stop smoking if you smoke. Smoking causes irritation and inflammation, and also increases the likelihood of serious medical conditions.</li>
	<li>If you feel a respiratory infection coming on, drink more water. Drinking water can thin out phlegm and help flush it out.</li>
	<li>Keep your house clean because dust is easy to breathe in, and it can irritate your lungs and make your symptoms worse if you have COPD, asthma, or a lung infection. Mold and mildew can also cause respiratory infections and irritation, which can lead to blood-tinged sputum.</li>
	<li>Coughing up yellow and green phlegm may be a sign of a respiratory infection. See your doctor for treatment early on to help prevent complications or a worsening of symptoms later.</li>
</ul>
<h1><b>Treatments</b></h1>
<p>Treating blood-tinged sputum will rely on treating the underlying condition causing it. In some cases, treatment can also involve reducing inflammation or other related symptoms you’re experiencing.<br>

Treatments for blood-tinged sputum can include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>oral antibiotics for infections like bacterial pneumonia</li>
	<li>antivirals, such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu), to reduce the duration or severity of a viral infection</li>
	<li>cough suppressants for a prolonged cough</li>
	<li>drinking more water, which can help flush out remaining phlegm</li>
	<li>surgery to treat a tumor or blood clot</li>
</ul>
<p>For people who are coughing up large amounts of blood, treatment first focuses on stopping the bleeding, preventing aspiration, which occurs when foreign material gets into your lungs, and then treating the underlying cause.<br>Call your doctor before using any cough suppressants, even if you know the underlying cause of your symptoms. Cough suppressants can lead to airway obstructions or keep the sputum trapped in your lungs, prolonging or worsening an infection.</p>
