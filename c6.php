<h1><b>What causes chronic pain?</b></h1>
<p>Chronic pain is usually caused by an initial injury, such as a back sprain or pulled muscle. It’s believed that chronic pain develops after nerves become damaged. The nerve damage makes pain more intense and long lasting. In these cases, treating the underlying injury may not resolve the chronic pain.<br>In some cases, however, people experience chronic pain without any prior injury. The exact causes of chronic pain without injury aren’t well understood. The pain may sometimes result from an underlying health condition, such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>chronic fatigue syndrome:</b>characterized by extreme, prolonged weariness that’s often accompanied by pain</li>
	<li><b>endometriosis:</b>a painful disorder that occurs when the uterine lining grows outside of the uterus</li>
	<li><b>fibromyalgia:</b>widespread pain in the bones and muscles</li>
	<li><b>inflammatory bowel disease:</b>a group of conditions that causes painful, chronic inflammation in the digestive tract</li>
	<li><b>interstitial cystitis:</b>a chronic disorder marked by bladder pressure and pain</li>
	<li><b>temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMJ):</b>a condition that causes painful clicking, popping, or locking of the jaw</li>
	<li><b>vulvodynia:</b>chronic vulva pain that occurs with no obvious cause</li>
</ul>
<h1><b>Prevention</b></h1>
<ul>
	<li> Don't ignore acute pain. Make sure to pursue adequate and prompt treatment when experiencing acute pain.</li>
	<li> Engage in a healthy lifestyle. Ensure that you include regular exercise, good nutrition and weight management in your regular schedule. It is also important to quit smoking and limit alcohol consumption.</li>
	<li> Maintain strong social supports. Stay connected to your family, friends and co-workers.</li>
	<li> Get enough sleep. Sleep restores your energy so that you can better manage pain.</li>
	<li> Reduce your stress levels. Get organized, use stress management techniques and plan ahead to reduce stress both at home and at work. </li>
	<li> Update your work station. Make sure you have good ergonomic design in your workplace. </li>
	<li> Use  appropriate headrest and seatbelts in motor vehicles. Using your head restraint appropriately can reduce the chance of whiplash injuries in rear-end collisions by 35%. </li>
	<li> Avoid high-risk sports and other hazardous activities. </li>
</ul>
<h1><b>Home Remedies</b></h1>
<ul>
	<li><b>Exercise:</b>"People who exercise and maintain a good aerobic condition will improve most pain conditions," says Charles Kim, MD, assistant professor of rehabilitation medicine and anesthesiology and a certified medical acupuncturist at Rusk Rehabilitation at NYU Langone Medical Center.</li>
	<li><b>Fish Oil:</b> Fish oil is known for its anti-inflammatory properties, and inflammation plays a large role in pain, says Michael Cronin, ND, a naturopathic physician in Scottsdale, Az., and immediate past president of the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians.</li>
	<li><b>Turmeric:</b>turmeric is basically a root, Kim says. "It's often found in spicy foods, very much in Indian cooking. Studies have shown it has definite anti-inflammatory properties."<br>Researchers who tested a combination of turmeric with two other substances, Devil's claw and bromelain, on patients with pain from osteoarthritis found the mixture gave noticeable pain relief. Patients took two 650-milligram capsules either two or three times a day.</li>
	<li><b>Resveratrol:</b> Found in red wine, grapes and berries, resveratrol is known to have many beneficial effects, including anti-cancer, brain protective and even life-prolonging benefits.<br>Recently, researchers reported that the substance works on a cellular level for pain regulation.</li>
	<li><b>Heat Therapy:</b>Using heat as well as cold therapy are time-honored ways to quell pain, Dr. Cronin and Kim agree.<br>"Hot Epsom salt baths relax the mind and change the nervous input from the body to the brain," Cronin says. "Using ice is a well-accepted modality that decreases inflammation locally."<br>The key is to know when to use which.<br>"When you have an acute injury, put ice on it right away," Kim says. For instance, you twist your ankle and it's painful and swollen. Using heat in this situation will increase blood flow and increase the swelling, he says.<br>"If you have lingering back spasms, heat would be the best for that," Kim says. He suggests taking a warm shower and massaging your neck or back (or whatever body part hurts) under the warm water.</li>
	<li><b>Meditation:</b>Meditation can quell pain, Kim says. While some people get anxious, thinking they have to do meditation a certain way, Kim tells them it's just not true.<br>"Meditation is not scripted," he says. While you can get instruction, you can also look up approaches and follow instructions, such as this information on the approach known as mindfulness meditation.<br>Researchers who assigned 109 patients with chronic pain to either a mindfulness meditation program or a wait list found that those who did the meditation reported more pain relief, as well as lower anxiety and depression and a better mental quality of life, than those who did not.</li>
