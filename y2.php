<h1><b>What Causes Yellow Eyes?</b></h1>
<p>Yellowing of the eyes occurs if you have jaundice. Jaundice occurs when the oxygen-carrying components in the blood, called hemoglobin, break down into bilirubin and your body doesn’t clear the bilirubin. Bilirubin is supposed to move from the liver to the bile ducts, and then your body should release it in your stool. If any part of this process does not occur, bilirubin builds up in your skin and causes it to appear yellow. This also can occur in your eyes. </p><br>
<p>The white portion of the eye is known as the sclera. Healthy eye tissue should appear white. Yellowing of the eyes suggests there’s an underlying medical condition present.</p>
<h1>Yellowing of the eyes can occur due to dysfunction of:</h1>
<ul>
	<li>the liver</li>
	<li>the gallbladder</li>
	<li>the pancreas</li>
	<li>multiple organs</li>
	
</ul>
<h1><b>Conditions that affect the liver</b></h1>
<p>The liver performs numerous important functions for the body, including breaking down red blood cells. Conditions that affect the liver’s functioning can lead to yellowing of the eyes. Liver scarring, or cirrhosis, commonly causes this to occur. Conditions that can cause cirrhosis include: </p>
<ul>
	<li>alcohol abuse </li>
	<li>liver cancer</li>
	<li>liver infection</li>
	<li>non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is a condition that commonly occurs in obese people </li>
	<li>hepatitis B and C </li>
</ul>
<p>Hepatitis A, D, and E can also cause jaundice, but these are less common causes of jaundice than hepatitis B and C.</p>
<h1><b>prevention</b></h1>
<ul>
	<li> Exclusion of people with yellow fever from childcare, preschool, school or work is not necessary but people should avoid being bitten by mosquitoes while they are unwell.</li>
	<li> Vaccination is the single most important measure for preventing yellow fever. Vaccination is recommended for all travellers to countries where yellow fever transmission occurs.</li>
	<li>A number of countries have specific mandatory vaccination requirements for travellers entering that country. Many countries, including Australia, require travellers coming from yellow fever infected countries to show proof of immunisation upon entry. This should be kept in mind when planning a travel itinerary. </li>
</ul>
<h1><b>Natural remedies for yellow eyes</b></h1>
<ul>
	<li> People all over the world have their own herbal remedies for treating yellow eyes. Common herbal remedies often include ingredients such as lemons, carrots, or chamomile. <br>Some believe these ingredients boost gallbladder, liver, and pancreas function, which would improve jaundice.People all over the world have their own herbal remedies for treating yellow eyes.
