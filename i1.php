<li><b>Add More Calories to Your Meals:</b>One way to do this is to cook your foods with calorie-dense ingredients like butter, nut butters, olive oil or whole milk.</li>
<li><b>Make Mealtime an Enjoyable Social Activity:</b>To make foods more pleasant to eat, you can invite friends and family over for meals. If they cannot come over to keep you company, try eating while watching TV.</li>
<li><b>Trick Your Brain With Different Plate Sizes:</b>Some studies have shown that increases in plate size can make you serve larger food portions. This is true even when you do not like the food all that much (2, 3).In other words, you could eat more food if you serve it in a larger dish. This could increase your daily calorie intake, especially if you eat high-calorie foods.</li>
<li><b>Don't Skip Breakfast:</b>Furthermore, breakfast helps increase the body's thermogenesis effect, making you burn more calories throughout the day.</li>
