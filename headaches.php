<h1><b>Primary causes of headaches</b></h1>
<p>Doctors have identified several different causes of headaches.<br>

Primary causes of headaches are causes that aren’t related to separate medical conditions. These headaches are the result of an underlying process in the brain. Examples of common primary headaches include migraine, cluster, and tension headaches.</p>
<h1><b>Secondary causes of headaches</b></h1>
<p>Secondary headaches are those that are due to an underlying medical condition. Examples of secondary headache causes include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Brain tumor or brain aneurysm</b><br>The presence of a brain tumor or brain aneurysm (brain bleed) can lead to headache. This is because there is only so much room in the skull. When the skull starts to build up with blood or extra tissue, the compression on the brain can cause a headache.</li>
	<li><b>Cervicogenic headaches</b><br>The presence of a brain tumor or brain aneurysm (brain bleed) can lead to headache. This is because there is only so much room in the skull. When the skull starts to build up with blood or extra tissue, the compression on the brain can cause a headache.</li>
	<li><b>Cervicogenic headaches</b><br>Cervicogenic headaches occur when discs start to degenerate and press on the spinal column. The result can be significant neck pain as well as headaches.</li>
	<li><b>Medication overuse headaches</b><br>If a person takes a significant amount of pain medications daily and starts to taper them or discontinue them altogether, a headache can result. Examples of these medications include hydrocodone.</li>
	<li><b>Meningitis-related headache</b><br>Meningitis is an infection of the meninges, which are the membranes that line the skull and enclose the spinal cord and brain.</li>
	<li><b>Post-traumatic headache</b><br>Sometimes a person will experience headaches after trauma to the head, sustained during an event like a fall, car accident, or skiing accident.</li>
	<li><b>Sinus headaches</b><br>Inflammation in the normally air-filled sinus cavities in the face can cause pressure and pain that leads to a sinus headache.</li>
</ul>
<h1><b>Headache prevention</b></h1>
<p>A healthy lifestyle and plenty of sleep can help prevent headaches. Some key steps a person can take to reduce their chances of experiencing a headache include:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Avoiding diet-related food triggers.</b>While these can vary from person to person, foods known to trigger headaches include aged cheeses, wine, cashews, onions, chocolate, processed meats, dark beers, food additives, dairy, and wheat. Whenever possible, a person should avoid food additives and eat whole foods.</li>
	<li><b>Avoiding excess caffeine intake.</b>Drinking six or more cups of coffee a day can lead to chronic headaches due to withdrawal episodes. Limiting caffeine to two to three cups per day (or none at all) can help.</li>
	<li><b>Getting enough sleep.</b>Lack of sleep is a common headache trigger. Good headache prevention includes getting an amount of sleep each night that allows you to wake up feeling refreshed in the morning.</li>
	<li><b>Using mind-body practices for headache prevention.</b>People with tension headaches can benefit from using techniques like progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery. These techniques involve focusing the mind on the body, deep breathing, and imagining each tense muscle in the body relaxing.</li>
	<li><b>Considering manual therapies.</b>Therapies including massage and chiropractic manipulations may help prevent headaches in some people. However, a person should always talk to their doctor before using these therapies.</li>
	<li><b>Exercising regularly.</b>Exercising at least three times a week for 30 minutes can help relieve stress and tension that may otherwise trigger headaches. Even if you’re short on time, breaking up exercise sessions into 10- or 15-minute segments can help.</li>
</ul>

<p>Typically, good health practices also are good headache prevention practices.

<h1><b>Headache natural remedies</b></h1>
<p>Some people may choose to manage or attempt to treat and prevent their headaches through taking vitamins and herbs. You should always talk to your doctor before starting any new medications to make sure they don’t negatively interact with something you’re already taking. Some natural remedies a person may take to reduce headaches include:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Butterbur</b>Extracts from this shrub have been shown to reduce the frequency at which migraines occur, according to the National Institutes of Health. While people generally tolerate the herb well, there have been some reports of allergic reactions in those allergic to ragweed, marigolds, daisies, and chrysanthemums.</li>
	<li><b>Coenzyme Q10</b>Taking 100 milligrams (mg) of this enzyme three times a day (or taking a single 150-mg dose per day) may reduce the frequency of migraine headaches, according to the University of Minnesota.</li>
	<li><b>Feverfew</b>Feverfew is an herb that can potentially decrease the incidence of migraines. However, there aren’t a lot of scientific studies to back this up.</li>
	<li><b>Magnesium</b>Some patients with severe migraines receive magnesium infusions as a means to reduce their headache. However, those with other headache types may also take this supplement as well.</li>
	<li><b>Vitamin B-12</b>Also known as riboflavin, this vitamin may have headache-reducing properties. According to the University of Minnesota, taking 200 mg twice daily can help.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to herbs and supplements, some people reduce their headaches through alternative medicine practices. Examples include Chinese medicine, such as massage and acupuncture. However, a person may have to participate in multiple acupuncture sessions across the course of several weeks to experience the best benefits. Read more about natural remedies for headaches.</p>
