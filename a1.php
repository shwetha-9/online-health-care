<h1><b>What Causes Abdominal Tenderness?</b></h1>
<p>Abdominal tenderness, or point tenderness in your abdomen, is when pressure on an area of your abdomen causes pain.<br> It may also feel sore and tender.<br> If the removal of pressure causes pain, then that is known as rebound tenderness or Blumberg sign.<br> Point tenderness is often a sign that something is wrong with one or more organs in the area.<br> </p>
